# EmPy template syntax support for VSCode

Adds syntax highlighting to [EmPy](http://www.alcyone.com/software/empy/) files in VSCode.

All templates should end with `.em`.
A second extension can be used to select the grammar of the non-templated part, e.g. `.cpp.em`.
Currently the following subgrammars are being supported:

* Batchfile
* C
* C++
* CMake
* Dockerfile
* Groovy
* HTML
* PowerShell
* Python
* Shell Script
* XML

Contributions are greatly appreciated.
Please fork this repository and open a pull request to make grammar tweaks, add support for other subgrammars etc.
